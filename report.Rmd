\textbf{Conclusion:} Better predictive models for identifying how many days a patient will spend in the hospital in the future allows health care providers to allocate available resources more effectively for better patient care delivery. We demonstrate that ensemble machine learning methods, such as GBM, can effectively use patient data to accurately predict future length of stay in the hospital. Further, we identified the most important predictors of longer hospital stays in the future; the number of times an individual visits the emergency room and inpatient group place-of-service are strongly associated with futre length of hospital stay. In tandem, these analyses allow health care providers to better plan for the future by identifying patients most at risk of returning to the hospital for longer stays.
